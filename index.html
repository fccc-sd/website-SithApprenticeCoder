        <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>
        My imediate family consists of me, my dad, my sister, and my mom.
        We also have 4 dogs and a tortoise. My dog's names are Jango,
        Maggy, Arwen, and Leia. My tortoise's name is Morla, named after
        the giant tortoise from <em><strong>The Neverending Story &trade;</strong></em>.
        The dogs are named after a few different things. Jango and Leia 
        are named after <em><strong>Star Wars &trade;</strong></em> characters, Jango being a 
        bounty hunter from <em><strong>The Prequel Trilogy</strong></em>
        and Leia being the princess from <em><strong>The Original Trilogy</strong></em>
        and some of <em><strong>The Sequel Trilogy</strong></em>. Maggy is 
        just named Maggy because we liked the name better than Paige.
        Arwen is named after Lady Arwen from <em><strong>The Lord of the Rings &trade;</strong></em>.

     <h2>Me</h2>
        <p>
        I don't have a lot of things about me. The few things I can think
        of is I have a <span id="Something I like To Do">YouTube channel</span> 
        and I can create some ok things.I don't like most of my videos because 
        I hate how I am and I think my videos are pretty cringe. I do like the sculptures I have
        made in <em><strong>Blender</strong></em> and what I've made width
        clay. I have made things from my own imagination mainly, but have made 
        things from <em><strong>Marvel &trade;</strong></em>, <em>Star Wars &trade;</em>,
        and other movies and games. The thing is, <em>Blender</em> is free while
        clay costs anywhere from 20 dollars to 150 dollars, but I feel like I 
        am better with clay than I am with <em>Blender</em>. Of course, I have done 
        clay for way longer than I have done Blender.

    <h2>Hobbies and Activities</h2>

    <p>
        I have a few hobbies and/or activities I participate in. I like to make things and 
        do things. The things I like to make varies depending
        on where I am. When I'm home, I sometimes make videos once every blue moon.
        When I'm at a sand bank, I make either clay castles or sand mud castles.
        What I create depends on the setting on which I am in. I like to do things 
        too. I like to swim, bike, and walk every so often. There isn't as much to
        say about this because it's kind of explanatory, but I usually do all of This
        with my friends. The other things I do with the majority of my time is stay
        inside and watch YouTube. I don't usually have much to do when I get home 
        after work, which is right after I get home from school. I have a job at
        the <em><strong>Hometown Meat Market</strong></em> in <em><strong>Pioneer, Ohio</strong></em>.
