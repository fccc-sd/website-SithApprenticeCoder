        <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>
        My imediate family consists of me, my dad, my sister, and my mom.
        We also have 4 dogs and a tortoise. My dog's names are Jango,
        Maggy, Arwen, and Leia. My tortoise's name is Morla, named after
        the giant tortoise from <em><strong>The Neverending Story &trade;</strong></em>.
        The dogs are named after a few different things. Jango and Leia 
        are named after <em><strong>Star Wars &trade;</strong></em> characters, Jango being a 
        bounty hunter from <em><strong>The Prequel Trilogy</strong></em>
        and Leia being the princess from <em><strong>The Original Trilogy</strong></em>
        and some of <em><strong>The Sequel Trilogy</strong></em>. Maggy is 
        just named Maggy because of some song my dad has listened to.
        Arwen is named after Lady Arwen from <em><strong>The Lord of the Rings &trade;</strong></em>.

     <h2>Me</h2>
        <p>
        I don't have a lot of things about me. The few things I can think
        I don't like most of my videos because I hate how I am and I 
        think my videos are pretty cringe. I do like the sculptures I have
        made in <em><strong>Blender</strong></em> and what I've made width
        clay. I have made things from my own imagination mainly, but have made 
        things from <em><strong>Marvel &trade;</strong></em>, <em>Star Wars &trade;</em>,
        and other movies and games. The thing is, <em>Blender</em> is free while
        clay costs anywhere from 20 dollars to 150 dollars, but I feel like I 
        am better with clay than I am with <em>Blender</em>. Of course, I have done 
        clay for way longer than I have done Blender.

    <h2>Hobbies and Activities</h2>
    <p>
        I have a few hobbies and/or activities I participate in. I like to make things and 
        do things. The things I like to make varies depending
        on where I am. When I'm home, I sometimes make videos once every blue moon.
        When I'm at a sand bank, I mess with the clay or make sand mud castles.
        What I create depends on the setting on which I am in. I like to do things 
        too. I like to swim, bike, and walk every so often. There isn't as much to
        say about this because it's kind of explanatory, but I usually do all of This
        with my friends. The other things I do with the majority of my time is stay
        inside and watch <em><strong>YouTube</strong></em>. I don't usually have much to do when I get home 
        after work, which is right after I get home from school. I have a job at
        the <em><strong>Hometown Meat Market</strong></em> in <em><strong>Pioneer, Ohio</strong></em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Other Things</h2>

    <p>
        I also LOVE music. I mainly listen to rock, but also listen to
        subgenres, like metal and thrash metal. Some bands I listen to are 
        <em><strong><span>Metallica</span></strong></em>, <em><strong>Soundgarden</strong></em>, 
        <em><strong>Alice in Chains</strong></em>, <em><strong>Starset</strong></em>, 
        and many more that would take me very long to list. I like my old music, but 
        but you are entitled to your own opinion. I respect <em>most</em> types of 
        music, but I don't listen to all of the genres and subgenres. Another thing I 
        listen to is OST (original soundtracks) from a few games and some movies, mainly
        <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> though. The best OST in my opinion is 
        <em><strong>Anakin vs. Obi Wan</strong></em> or <em><strong>Battle of the Heros</strong></em> , 
        whichever one it is, they bothgive you the same music. <em><strong>Anakin vs. Obi Wan</strong></em> is the OST 
        from Revenge of the Sith after Anakin turns to the dark side and they battle on Mustafar at the end. 
        So as long as I know the band or music, I can tell you almost everything about it.
